When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    It's nice to be able to have a backup of your work in case anything happens. Plus, remote repositories allow teammates to have access to what you're working on. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    With manual pulls, you can determine when something is actually ready to be in the remote repository and available for public/team use. If pulls were automatic, Git might be providing incomplete information and pushing it to Github. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    A fork is a way to clone a repository on Github and transfer it to your own Github respository while still maintaining a connection to the original. A clone is a copy, either within your local machine or from Github to your machine. A branch is a copy of a series of commits that you can use to work on new features, etc. and then merge with the master.  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
